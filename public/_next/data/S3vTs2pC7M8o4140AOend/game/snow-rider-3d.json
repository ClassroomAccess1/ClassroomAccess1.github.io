In this exciting snowboarding and sled‑riding game, your goal is to guide your character down a steep mountain covered in fresh powder while dodging obstacles like trees, rocks, fences, and snowmen.</p>\n  </div>\n\n  <div>\n    <h2 class=\"H22\">🎮 How to Play</h2>\n    <p>Use the left and right arrow keys (or A/D keys) to steer your snowboard, sled, or sleigh through the twists and turns of the slope.
